## Main portfolio

### I have knowledge in Java, Spring Boot, and JWT, which enables me to develop secure and efficient applications. I have experience with React, creating responsive and intuitive interfaces. I am also fluent in English, which is a valuable asset in the tech field. Currently, I am in my second semester of studying Systems Analysis and Development, and I am eager to start working in the field as soon as possible. I have two main projects that you can check out in the projects tab: one is a full-stack to-do list, and the other is a frontend supermarket website.
