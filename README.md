## Main portfolio

### I am currently focused on securing my first job as a front-end developer, eager to kickstart my career in the tech industry. After that, I plan to study back-end technologies to enhance my programming skills. Throughout my previous experiences, I have extensively interacted with customers, catering to their needs through face-to-face interactions and telephone. If you are seeking a driven and enthusiastic web developer to join your team, I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can add value. Please reach out to me to explore potential collaborations and learn more about my skills and experience.
